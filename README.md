# Unity Homework 3 ‚Äì Gameplay Patterns and Triggers

## üß© Task Implemented ‚Äì Assignment 2: Score UI using Canvas

HW3 assignment, I implemented **Task 2** from the optional changes list:

> ‚ú≥Ô∏è _"The player's score should no longer appear above the spaceship, but instead at a fixed position on the screen (e.g., top-right corner). The score display must remain correctly positioned even when the screen size or orientation changes. Use a Canvas."_

### ‚úîÔ∏è What was implemented:
- Created a **Canvas** with a `TextMeshProUGUI` text element positioned at the **top-right corner** of the screen.
- Used appropriate **anchors and offsets** to ensure responsive positioning for any screen size.
- Attached a `NumberField` script to the text element to allow displaying numbers.
- Attached a `GameStatusReader` script that **updates the score live from the `GAME_STATUS.playerScore` static variable**.
- Verified that score updates appear instantly on screen during gameplay.
- Used `TextMeshPro` for sharper text rendering and added a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary Unity-generated files from the repository.

A project with step-by-step scenes illustrating some of the formal elements of game development in Unity, including: 

* Prefabs for instantiating new objects;
* Colliders for triggering outcomes of actions;
* Coroutines for setting time-based rules.

Text explanations are available 
[here](https://github.com/gamedev-at-ariel/gamedev-5782) in folder 04.

## Cloning
To clone the project, you may need to install git lfs first (if it is not already installed):

    git lfs install 

To clone faster, you can limit the depth to 1 like this:

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/<repository-name>.git

When you first open this project, you may not see the text in the score field.
This is because `TextMeshPro` is not in the project.
The Unity Editor should hopefully prompt you to import TextMeshPro;
once you do this, re-open the scenes, and you should be able to see the texts.
